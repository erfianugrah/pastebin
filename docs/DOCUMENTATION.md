   - [Frontend](FRONTEND.md) - Frontend architecture, browser integration, and performance
   - [Encryption](ENCRYPTION.md) - End-to-end encryption implementation
   - [API Reference](API.md) - API endpoints and integration
   - [Setup & Development](DEVELOPMENT.md) - Development workflow

2. **Testing Guides**
   - [E2EE Testing](E2EE_TESTING.md) - Testing procedures for encryption

3. **Roadmap & Planning**
   - [Enhancement Plan 2025](ENHANCEMENT_PLAN_2025.md) - Planned improvements

All other documentation has been consolidated to reduce duplication and improve navigation.
