- [x] Created repository interfaces
- [x] Added basic service abstractions
- [x] Set up testing infrastructure with Vitest

## Phase 2: Core Functionality (Completed)

- [x] Integrated syntax highlighting
- [x] Implement delete functionality
- [ ] Add admin dashboard
- [x] Implement rate limiting
- [x] Add password protection
- [ ] Create API documentation
- [x] Implement view count tracking

## Phase 4: Refinement (Planned)

- [ ] Add performance optimizations
- [ ] Implement full text search
- [ ] Create analytics dashboard
- [ ] Add abuse prevention measures
- [ ] Set up monitoring and alerting
- [ ] Create CI/CD pipelines

## Technical Debt and Issues

1. KV namespace IDs need to be properly configured in wrangler.jsonc
2. Additional tests needed for API handlers
3. ~~Need to implement proper rate limiting~~ (Implemented)
4. Consider adding request logging middleware
5. HTML renderer should be refactored to use templating
6. Add authentication for delete functionality
7. Implement owner tokens for paste management

## Next Steps

1. Complete remaining test coverage
2. Add proper documentation for API endpoints
3. Create admin dashboard
4. Configure a proper KV namespace for production
5. Deploy to Cloudflare Workers
