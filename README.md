```

- **Backend**
  - Cloudflare Workers: Serverless edge computing
  - TypeScript: Strongly typed JavaScript
  - Zod: Runtime schema validation
  - Pino: Structured logging
  - Cloudflare KV: Key-value storage

- **Frontend**
  - Astro: Static site generation
  - React: Interactive UI components
  - Tailwind CSS: Utility-first styling
  - Prism.js: Advanced syntax highlighting
  - shadcn/ui: Accessible component library

## Architecture

This project follows Domain-Driven Design principles with a clean architecture approach:

```mermaid
graph TD
    User[User/Client] --> UI[Interface Layer]
    UI --> Application[Application Layer]
    Application --> Domain[Domain Layer]
    Application --> Infrastructure[Infrastructure Layer]
    Domain --> Infrastructure
    
    subgraph "Interface Layer"
      WebUI[Web UI/Astro]
      API[API Endpoints]
    end
    
    subgraph "Application Layer"
      Commands[Command Handlers]
      Queries[Query Handlers]
    end
    
    subgraph "Domain Layer"
      Models[Domain Models]
      Services[Domain Services]
      Repositories[Repository Interfaces]
    end
    
    subgraph "Infrastructure Layer"
      Storage[KV Storage]
      Logging[Logging Services]
      Config[Configuration]
      Security[Security Controls]
    end
```

- **Domain Layer**: Core business logic and entities (Paste model, repositories)
- **Application Layer**: Use cases and application orchestration (commands/queries)
- **Infrastructure Layer**: Technical capabilities (storage, logging, caching)
- **Interface Layer**: User interfaces (API endpoints, Astro pages, React components)

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js (v18+)
- npm or yarn
- Wrangler CLI (`npm install -g wrangler`)
- Cloudflare account

### Installation

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/username/pastebin.git
cd pastebin

# Install dependencies
npm install
```

### Development

The project includes several npm scripts to help with development:

```bash
# Start development server for backend
npm run dev

# Start UI development server
npm run dev:ui

# Start both backend and UI servers concurrently
npm run dev:all

# Run TypeScript type checking
npm run check

# Run tests
npm test
```

### Configuration

The application is configured through `wrangler.jsonc`. You need to:

1. Create a KV namespace for paste storage
2. Update the `wrangler.jsonc` with your KV namespace ID
3. Configure any custom domains if needed

### Deployment

Deploy to Cloudflare Workers:

```bash
# Deploy to staging
npm run deploy:staging

# Deploy to production
npm run deploy:prod
```
