- **Backend**
  - Cloudflare Workers: Serverless edge computing
  - TypeScript: Strongly typed JavaScript
  - Zod: Runtime schema validation
  - Pino: Structured logging
  - Cloudflare KV: Key-value storage

- **Frontend**
  - Astro: Static site generation
  - React: Interactive UI components
  - Tailwind CSS: Utility-first styling
  - Prism.js: Advanced syntax highlighting
  - shadcn/ui: Accessible component library
  - TweetNaCl.js: Cryptographic operations

## Architecture

This project follows Domain-Driven Design principles with a clean architecture approach:

```mermaid
graph TD
    User[User] --> UI[Interface]
    UI --> App[Application]
    App --> Domain[Domain]
    App --> Infra[Infrastructure]
    
    subgraph "Interface"
      Web[Web UI]
      API[API]
    end
    
    subgraph "Application"
      Cmd[Commands]
      Qry[Queries]
    end
    
    subgraph "Domain"
      Model[Models]
      Svc[Services]
      Repo[Repositories]
    end
    
    subgraph "Infrastructure"
      KV[Storage]
      Log[Logging]
      Cfg[Config]
      Sec[Security]
      Err[Error Handling]
    end
```

- **Domain Layer**: Core business logic and entities (Paste model, repositories)
- **Application Layer**: Use cases and application orchestration (commands/queries)
- **Infrastructure Layer**: Technical capabilities (storage, logging, caching, error handling)
- **Interface Layer**: User interfaces (API endpoints, Astro pages, React components)

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js (v18+)
- npm or yarn
- Wrangler CLI (`npm install -g wrangler`)
- Cloudflare account

### Installation

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/username/pastebin.git
cd pastebin

# Install dependencies
npm install
```

### Development

The project includes several npm scripts to help with development:

```bash
# Start development server for backend
npm run dev

# Start UI development server
npm run dev:ui

# Start both backend and UI servers concurrently
npm run dev:all

# Run TypeScript type checking
npm run check

# Run tests
npm test
```

### Configuration

The application is configured through `wrangler.jsonc`. You need to:

1. Create a KV namespace for paste storage
2. Update the `wrangler.jsonc` with your KV namespace ID
3. Configure any custom domains if needed

### Deployment

Deploy to Cloudflare Workers:

```bash
# Deploy to staging
npm run deploy:staging

# Deploy to production
npm run deploy:prod
```

## Recent Improvements

### Error Handling System

We've implemented a comprehensive error handling system that provides:

- **Standardized Error Types**: Hierarchical error classes for consistent error handling
- **Error Categorization**: Automatic categorization by error type (network, crypto, validation, etc.)
- **User-Friendly Messages**: Context-aware error messages that guide users
- **React Error Hooks**: Custom React hooks for component-level error handling
- **Error Boundaries**: React error boundaries to prevent component crashes
- **Privacy-Aware Logging**: Error logging that redacts sensitive information

### React Component Structure

- **Reusable UI Components**: Extended shadcn/ui with custom components
- **Form Validation**: Standardized validation rules and error display
- **Component Hooks**: Custom hooks for common operations (async, timeout, etc.)
- **Error Displays**: Consistent error presentation across the application

## Improvement Roadmap

### 1. Input Validation

- Create centralized validation utility
- Implement field-specific validation
- Add real-time validation feedback
- Enhance password strength validation
- Add Base64 and URL validation for cryptographic keys

### 2. Accessibility
