# Accessibility Improvement Plan

## Current State

While the pastebin application has some basic accessibility features through Tailwind UI components, it lacks comprehensive accessibility support, particularly for screen readers and keyboard navigation.

## Objectives

- Achieve WCAG 2.1 AA compliance
- Ensure full keyboard navigation support
- Optimize screen reader experience
- Improve focus management and visual indicators

## Approach

### 1. Semantic HTML and ARIA Roles

- Audit all components for proper semantic HTML usage
- Add appropriate ARIA attributes and landmarks
- Ensure all interactive elements have accessible names
- Implement proper heading hierarchy

### 2. Keyboard Navigation

- Ensure all interactive elements are keyboard accessible
- Implement logical tab order
- Add keyboard shortcuts for common actions
- Create skip links for navigation

### 3. Focus Management

- Improve focus indicators (beyond browser defaults)
- Manage focus during modal dialogs and dynamic content changes
- Ensure focus is managed during error states
- Prevent focus traps

### 4. Screen Reader Support

- Add descriptive alt text for all images
- Implement aria-live regions for dynamic content
- Ensure form labels are properly associated with inputs
- Add screen reader announcements for state changes

### 5. Color and Contrast

- Audit all color usage for sufficient contrast ratios
- Ensure information is not conveyed by color alone
- Add high contrast mode support
- Test with various color vision deficiency simulations

## Implementation Plan

1. **Phase 1: Audit and Assessment**
   - Conduct comprehensive accessibility audit
   - Use automated tools (Axe, Lighthouse) for initial scan
   - Manual testing with keyboard-only navigation
   - Screen reader testing

2. **Phase 2: Core Components Enhancement**
   - Update form components with proper ARIA attributes
   - Enhance button and interactive element accessibility
   - Improve modal and dialog accessibility
   - Add keyboard shortcuts

3. **Phase 3: Focus and Navigation**
   - Implement improved focus styles
   - Add skip links
   - Fix tab order issues
   - Enhance toast notifications for accessibility

4. **Phase 4: Testing and Refinement**
   - Test with screen readers (NVDA, VoiceOver, JAWS)
   - Keyboard-only user testing
   - Contrast and color testing
   - Gather feedback from users with disabilities

## Component-Specific Improvements

### Forms (PasteForm.tsx)
- Add proper label associations
- Implement error message announcements
- Add field descriptions for screen readers
- Improve form validation feedback

### CodeViewer
- Add keyboard shortcuts for navigation
- Implement proper code semantics for screen readers
- Add region landmarks

### Modals and Toasts
- Implement focus trapping in modals
- Add proper ARIA roles and attributes
- Ensure screen reader announcements for notifications

### General UI
- Improve button and link text for screen readers
- Add skip links for navigation
- Implement consistent focus indicators
