# State Management Improvement Plan

## Current State

The pastebin application currently uses React's built-in useState and useEffect hooks for state management. While this works for simpler components, more complex interactions and shared state would benefit from a more structured approach.

## Objectives

- Implement a more robust state management approach
- Reduce state-related bugs and race conditions
- Improve code maintainability and readability
- Enhance performance for complex state updates

## Approach

### 1. Evaluate State Management Needs

#### Local Component State
- Identify which components should maintain local state
- Keep UI-specific state at component level
- Use useState for simple, isolated state

#### Application State
- Identify shared state that needs global management
- Determine state that persists across route changes
- Identify complex state with multiple updaters

#### Server State
- Separate server data fetching from UI state
- Implement proper caching and invalidation
- Handle loading/error states consistently

### 2. Implement Layered State Management

#### Component Level
- Use React.useReducer for complex local state
- Implement custom hooks for reusable state logic
- Create controlled components for form state

#### Application Level
- Implement Context API for shared state
- Create state providers with proper memoization
- Design action creators and reducers

#### Data Fetching
- Implement react-query or SWR for server state
- Handle caching and background updates
- Implement optimistic updates

### 3. State Management Patterns

#### State Machines
- Use state machines for complex workflows
- Implement XState for critical processes
- Document state transitions

#### Immutable Updates
- Ensure proper immutable update patterns
- Implement utility functions for immutable updates
- Add proper memoization

#### Performance Optimizations
- Implement selective re-rendering
- Use React.memo and useMemo appropriately
- Split contexts to prevent unnecessary re-renders

## Implementation Plan

1. **Phase 1: Assessment and Architecture**
   - Audit current state management
   - Design state architecture
   - Create state management utility functions
   - Document state management patterns

2. **Phase 2: Core State Management**
   - Implement Context providers
   - Create reducers for complex state
   - Add custom hooks for state access
   - Implement server state management

3. **Phase 3: Component Refactoring**
   - Refactor PasteForm to use useReducer
   - Update CodeViewer with new state patterns
   - Implement state machines for encryption workflow
   - Refactor error handling with state management

4. **Phase 4: Testing and Documentation**
   - Test state transitions
   - Validate performance improvements
   - Document state management approach
   - Create examples for future components

## Component-Specific Improvements

### PasteForm.tsx
- Convert to useReducer for form state
- Implement state machine for multi-step form
- Separate UI state from form data
- Add proper validation state

### CodeViewer.tsx
- Implement state machine for decryption process
- Separate view state from content state
- Add proper caching for decrypted content
- Optimize rendering for large content

### Application State
- Create PasteContext for shared paste data
- Implement UserPreferencesContext for settings
- Add NotificationContext for system messages
- Create EncryptionContext for crypto operations

## Benefits

- Reduced bugs from incorrect state updates
- Improved performance through optimized rendering
- Better developer experience with structured state
- Easier testing of state logic
- Improved maintainability for complex components
