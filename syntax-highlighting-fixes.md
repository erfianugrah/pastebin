# Syntax Highlighting Fixes

This document tracks progress on implementing proper syntax highlighting with Prism.js in the pastebin application.

## Current Issues

The pastebin application had syntax highlighting issues, especially with certain languages like JSON. The required fixes included:

1. Adding TypeScript definitions for Prism.js
2. Importing a Prism.js theme
3. Importing language components for all supported languages in PasteForm.tsx
4. Updating the Prism.js invocation to use the imported instance instead of window.Prism

## Implementation Status

All required fixes have been implemented:

### ✅ 1. Install @types/prismjs
- Added TypeScript type definitions for better editor support
- Package installed with `npm install -D @types/prismjs`

### ✅ 2. Import Prism.js Theme
- Added import for the okaidia theme in CodeViewer.tsx
- Import statement: `import 'prismjs/themes/prism-okaidia.css';`

### ✅ 3. Import Core and Language Components
- Imported Prism.js core: `import Prism from 'prismjs';`
- Added imports for core language components:
  ```typescript
  // Core language components
  import 'prismjs/components/prism-clike';
  import 'prismjs/components/prism-markup'; // For HTML, XML, SVG, MathML
  import 'prismjs/components/prism-css';
  import 'prismjs/components/prism-javascript';
  ```
- Added imports for other supported languages including:
  - Web Development: JSX, TypeScript, TSX, PHP
  - Data Formats: JSON, YAML
  - Programming Languages: Python, Java, C#, C, C++, Go, Rust, Ruby, SQL
  - Shell and Markup: Bash, Markdown

### ✅ 4. Update Prism.js Invocation
- Updated the useEffect hook to use the imported Prism instance
- The component now uses `Prism.highlightElement()` directly instead of `window.Prism`
- Updated dependency array to re-run highlighting when language or content changes

## Notes

Some language components that were initially attempted couldn't be resolved and were removed from the imports:
- Some specialized format components like CSV, TOML, INI
- Some specific infrastructure components like HCL, Docker
- Some specialized components like Apache and MongoDB

This is because not all language components are available in the standard Prism.js package, and some might require additional plugins or custom builds.

The current implementation covers the most common languages used in the pastebin application, including JSON which was specifically mentioned as having issues.

## Future Improvements

1. For a production application, consider using code splitting to only load language components when needed.
2. Consider creating a custom Prism.js build through their website to include exactly the languages needed.
3. Add additional language components as needed if users request specific syntax highlighting support.
